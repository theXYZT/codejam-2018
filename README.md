# Google Code Jam 2018 Solutions ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Python%203-orange) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/theXYZT/codejam-2020)

My solutions to [Google Code Jam 2018](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive/2018) problems. All solutions are written in **Python 3** and will solve all the test sets. The solutions are written to run successfully on the Code Jam platform, which includes the following libraries:

 * Python 3.5.3
 * Numpy 1.16.2 (see note below)
 * Scipy 1.2.1 (see note below)

*Note: There were no external libraries available during the 2018 competition.
However, the testing platform retroactively allows for practice submissions to
use Numpy and Scipy. If any solutions use external libraries, I will state so
in the notes.*
